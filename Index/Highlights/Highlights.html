                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p> Welcome to my little corner, where you can see my favorite illustrations. 
                    Drawing, whether traditional or digital, had a huge impact on my creative journey 
                    as an artist, as it was the first form of art I fell in love with.
                </p>  
                <p>
                    I started drawing when I saw my sister's scribbles on the back of her notebook. When I 
                    knew how to draw, I and my sister would often make paper dolls. Later on, 
                    I started drawing characters from media I consumed like comics and animated shows. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                  I explored different mediums of drawing. My process of drawing was 
                  something I learned from my friends. The styles I used were from other artists. 
                  Even though it was inconsistent, I had a lot of exploration as an artist.

                <h2>Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes</h2>
                <p>
                    This was one of the pieces I did for a longest time. I remember drawing it in my phone 
                    and the application that I used would often crash. However, I was still able to finish it. 
                </p>
                <p> This illustration serves as a reminder that beauty is not only limited to one face and body.
                    It also shows that some features of our bodies are not flaws. These features are normal do not 
                    make anyone ugly.

                <h2>Draw This In Your Style Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    This illustration was based from a Draw This In Your Style Challenge by an artist, which is 
                    Popcorncheek. While their illustration is cute, I drew mine with a twist by giving it a 
                    spooky vibe. 
                </p>
                <p> For this DTIYS, I did two versions. One shows the features of the monsters that are looking for her. 
                    The other version shows her hiding in a cabinet. What I love about this piece are the character designs, 
                    her emotions, and the shadows.
